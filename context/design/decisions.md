# Design decisions

Why the stack is shaped the way it is. Everything below was verified against the
real thing on 2026-07-31, not taken from documentation or memory — the dates and
observed values are kept so a future reader can tell what has gone stale.

## The model

`Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` (released 2026-04-24), served from `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF`
(the MTP variant of the same UD-Q4_K_XL quant — see the settings review below).

Facts pulled from the model's own `config.json` rather than assumed:

| Property | Value | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` (`qwen3_5`) | Needs a llama.cpp new enough to have `conversion/qwen.py` — verified present |
| Layers | 64 | — |
| Layer layout | 16 × (3 × Gated DeltaNet → 1 × full attention) | Only **16 layers** hold a KV cache |
| Full-attention heads | 24 Q / 4 KV, head_dim 256 | ≈ 64 KiB of KV per token at f16, ~34 KiB at q8_0 |
| Native context | 262,144 | Far more than 24 GiB of VRAM can hold; we cap at 64K |
| Vision | SigLIP-style tower, `mmproj-F16.gguf` (0.93 GB) | Optional, off by default — forge does not use vision |
| Thinking | On by default, `<think>…</think>` | Needs a reasoning budget; see below |

The hybrid layout is the reason a 27B model is comfortable here at all. A dense 27B
with full attention on every layer would need ~4× the KV cache.

### Quant choice

`UD-Q4_K_XL` (16.4 GiB) over `Q4_K_M` (15.7 GiB): unsloth's dynamic quants hold
quality better at the same rung, and the 0.7 GiB difference is affordable — the
projected total at 64K context with a q8_0 KV cache is ~19.8 GiB against the
~22.4 GiB actually free (a desktop holds the rest). The README carries the full
ladder so dropping a rung is a one-line change.

## The backends

**llama-server, not Ollama or vLLM.** forge's own eval suite reports its top-10
configurations all running on llama-server, and `--jinja` gives real native function
calling. vLLM wants AWQ/GPTQ weights and is built for concurrent serving that a
single-user 4090 will not exercise.

**`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp`, pinned to an immutable per-build tag.** The floating
`server-cuda` tag pointed at build `b10200` (built 2026-07-31T08:46Z) at the time of
writing, and moves without warning. `.env` pins `server-cuda-b10200`; `update.sh`
reads the floating tag's `org.opencontainers.image.version` annotation to discover
the newest build and then pins *that* immutable tag. Reading the annotation beats
paging the tag list — the tags endpoint returns an unordered 100-tag page whose
newest entries were years stale.

**forge from PyPI, not from a git checkout.** `forge-guardrails==0.8.2` in a
`pip install` means updating is a version bump in `.env` and a rebuild, with no
submodule to keep in sync.

## Flags that are not obvious

Checked against `common/arg.cpp` at tag `b10200`:

- **`--jinja` is mandatory.** Without it llama.cpp ignores the `tools` parameter
  entirely. It does not error — it returns a perfectly normal text response, which
  reads as "this model is bad at tool calling" and sends you debugging the wrong
  thing. The smoke test asserts on `tool_calls` for exactly this reason.
- **`-fa` now takes a value** (`on`/`off`/`auto`). The bare `-fa` that older guides
  show is a parse error on current builds.
- **`--reasoning-budget` defaults to `-1` (unrestricted).** On reasoning-tagged
  models that is what lets a run fill the KV cache or hang. Capped at 4096 here;
  `0` disables thinking entirely.
- **`--reasoning-format deepseek`** is set explicitly so thoughts always land in
  `reasoning_content` instead of depending on template auto-detection.
- **`--no-context-shift`** makes an over-long conversation fail loudly instead of
  silently dropping the oldest tokens mid-session.
- Sampling follows Qwen's **precise-coding** thinking preset (`temp 0.6`,
  `top_p 0.95`, `top_k 20`, `min_p 0.0`) rather than the 1.0 general preset — see
  the settings review below. Client requests still override them.

### forge flags

`--budget-mode manual --budget-tokens ${CTX_SIZE}` pins forge's budget to the same
number llama-server booted with, so forge never probes for it and the two can never
disagree.

`--inject-respond-tool` is **off** (it is opt-in as of forge 0.8.x). It exists to
keep ~8B models from wandering out of tool-calling mode; a 27B does not need the
crutch. `FORGE_EXTRA_FLAGS` is there if that turns out to be wrong in practice.

## Environment traps that cost real time

**Docker Desktop bind mounts resolve on the Windows side.** A WSL-style source path
mounts an **empty directory** — it does not fail. Verified directly:

```
$ docker run --rm -v /home/you/proj/scripts:/x:ro alpine ls /x
                                        # ← empty, no error
$ docker run --rm -v //c/users/you/proj/scripts:/x:ro alpine ls /x
setup.sh  up.sh  smoke-test.sh  ...
```

Consequences baked into this repo:

- `MODELS_DIR` must be a `//d/...` path, and is documented as such.
- The helper scripts are **COPY'd into the forge image** rather than bind-mounted.
  A `./scripts` mount would have silently mounted nothing and surfaced as
  "python: can't open file '/work/scripts/smoke_test.py'".
- Build contexts are unaffected — those are read by the Docker CLI, not the daemon.

**Model storage goes on D:.** C: had 44.1 GiB free against D:'s 7.6 TiB, and Docker's
own named volumes live on C: inside the VM's virtual disk.

**A stale ghcr credential breaks *anonymous* pulls.** `~/.docker/config.json` held an
expired PAT for `ghcr.io`; Docker sent it and the registry answered `denied` on a
public image. It presents as an access problem with the image, not with the local
credential. Fixed by re-issuing from `gh auth token`.

**The Xet transfer backend stalled silently.** `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` is
deprecated in favour of Xet, so the downloader was switched to it — and Xet then
stopped dead at ~1.1 GB with the container still running, the connection still open,
no error, and no progress for ten minutes. The chunk cache inside the container was
only 1.2 MB, ruling out progress happening somewhere invisible.

Setting `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` (plain HTTP range requests) downloaded steadily at
~2.6 MB/s, which is *faster* than Xet managed before it hung. That is the default
here; flip it to `"0"` on a better-behaved network.

The download also retries up to `DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS` times (default 12), resuming from
the `.incomplete` file. Over an 18 GB pull on a slow link, a dropped connection is a
matter of when, not if.

**The link here is slow, and it is not HuggingFace's fault.** Measured concurrently:
GitHub 5 KB/s, PyPI 34 KB/s, HF ~1–2.6 MB/s. Always run the control before blaming
the remote.

## Verification

`scripts/smoke_test.py` runs inside the compose network so it exercises the same
service names forge uses, rather than the host port mapping. It checks reachability,
`/props` (context size and that a tool-aware chat template actually loaded), a plain
completion, an **OpenAI-format tool call**, and an **Anthropic-format tool call** —
the last being the path Claude Code takes. `update.sh` runs it after every update and
rolls back the pins if it fails.

## Settings taken from other public Qwen3.6 rigs

Three external configurations were reviewed. Flags were checked against
`common/arg.cpp` at b10200 before adopting anything — the value name is
`draft-mtp` with a hyphen, not the underscore form seen in some write-ups.

**Adopted:**

- **`--temp 0.6`** instead of 1.0. Qwen publishes two thinking-mode presets: 1.0 for
  general use, 0.6 for "precise coding". Two independent public rigs converged on 0.6,
  and this stack exists to drive a coding agent.
- **`-b 4096 -ub 2048`.** The default micro-batch of 512 leaves the GPU idle during
  prompt processing, which is the dominant per-turn cost for a client that resends a
  very large prompt every turn. Two external configs raise these; Thireus separately
  reports that larger batches *lower* perplexity.
- **MTP speculative decoding** (`--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 2`), with
  `MODEL_REPO` switched to `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF`. Decode speed only — output
  is unchanged. One public rig measured n-max 2 fastest, 3 no better, and 4 collapsing
  back to non-MTP speed. Not yet measured on this card; `SPEC_TYPE=` disables it.

**Rejected:**

- **`--reasoning-preserve`.** Real flag, but it governs how llama.cpp carries reasoning
  through chat history — and forge owns that concern via `--reasoning-replay`, sending
  a full message list every turn. Redundant at best, conflicting at worst.
- **DRY sampler** (`--dry-multiplier 1.2 --dry-allowed-length 2`, `--repeat-penalty 1.1`).
  Contradicts Qwen's own recommendation of `repetition_penalty 1.0`, and an allowed
  length of 2 is aggressive for code, where short token sequences repeat legitimately
  (indentation, `});`). Available via `LLAMA_EXTRA_FLAGS` if repetition loops show up.

**Note on a third-party spec sheet.** One reference circulated for this model lists
`head_dim=80, q_heads=64, kv_heads=64`. Qwen's published `config.json` says
`head_dim=256, 24 Q heads, 4 KV heads`. Any KV-cache sizing derived from the former
is wrong — the real per-token cost is ~4x what those numbers imply.

## Deliberately not done
- **Streaming through the proxy.** forge buffers responses rather than streaming
  incrementally, so a backend-side error arrives as an event inside an already-open
  200 stream. This is a documented forge limitation, not something this repo can fix.
- **Multi-model routing.** One model, one GPU, one slot (`-np 1`) so the single user
  gets the whole context window.


## Reversal: ik_llama.cpp was adopted after all

This route was rejected in an earlier pass, on two objections that turned out to be
false. Both were checkable rather than arguable, and checking took minutes:

1. *"The fork will not have the architecture."* It does — `LLM_ARCH_QWEN35` (plus
   `LLM_ARCH_QWEN3NEXT`) is in `src/llama-arch.cpp`.
2. *"Its server will not do native tool calling, forcing forge into prompt-injection
   mode."* It does — `--jinja`, `--reasoning-format`, `--reasoning-budget` and
   `--chat-template-kwargs` are all in `common/common.cpp`, and the fork carries
   `chat.cpp` with PEG/auto tool-call parsers.

A third objection was simply out of date: the fork publishes **prebuilt Ubuntu CUDA
binaries** with the CUDA runtime bundled, so there is no from-source build. A 1.3 GB
download replaces a 30-60 minute compile.

Worth recording how the first check nearly went wrong. `gh search code` returned zero
hits for both `qwen3_5` and `jinja` in the fork — which looks like confirmation of the
rejection. It was an artifact: **GitHub code search does not index forks.** The control
(fetching a file known to exist) failed too, showing the method was broken rather than
the feature absent. A negative result is worth nothing until the control passes.

### What the ik route actually buys

The recipe ladder for this model, all GPU-resident:

| bpw | Size | Perplexity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.4009 | 10 GB | 7.0303 |
| 4.2512 | 13 GB | 6.9155 |
| **5.1014** | **15 GB** | **6.9014** |
| 6.8018 | 21 GB | 6.9001 |

Perplexity is flat above 15 GB — the 21 GB recipe buys 0.0013 for 6 GB. The 15 GB rung
is chosen because it is *both* smaller than the 17.9 GB unsloth 4-bit file *and* higher
precision (5.1 bpw), which is what frees VRAM for context rather than spending it on
weights.

### Costs accepted

- **852 shards instead of one file.** Needs `ulimit -n` raised; the default 1024 fails
  mid-load as "too many open files" with nothing naming shards as the cause.
- **The model is engine-locked.** `iq4_ks`/`iq5_ks`/`iq6_k` do not exist in mainline, so
  these weights only ever run under ik_llama. The mainline profile is kept for exactly
  this reason.
- **`avx2` build, deliberately.** This host is a Ryzen 9 3900X with no AVX512; an
  avx512 archive would SIGILL at start.
