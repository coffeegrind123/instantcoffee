# Design decisions

Why the stack is shaped the way it is. Everything below was verified against the
real thing on 2026-07-31, not taken from documentation or memory — the dates and
observed values are kept so a future reader can tell what has gone stale.

## The model

`Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` (released 2026-04-24), served from `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF`.

Facts pulled from the model's own `config.json` rather than assumed:

| Property | Value | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` (`qwen3_5`) | Needs a llama.cpp new enough to have `conversion/qwen.py` — verified present |
| Layers | 64 | — |
| Layer layout | 16 × (3 × Gated DeltaNet → 1 × full attention) | Only **16 layers** hold a KV cache |
| Full-attention heads | 24 Q / 4 KV, head_dim 256 | ≈ 64 KiB of KV per token, so 2.0 GiB at 32K |
| Native context | 262,144 | Far more than 24 GiB of VRAM can hold; we cap at 32K |
| Vision | SigLIP-style tower, `mmproj-F16.gguf` (0.93 GB) | Optional, off by default — forge does not use vision |
| Thinking | On by default, `<think>…</think>` | Needs a reasoning budget; see below |

The hybrid layout is the reason a 27B model is comfortable here at all. A dense 27B
with full attention on every layer would need ~4× the KV cache.

### Quant choice

`UD-Q4_K_XL` (16.4 GiB) over `Q4_K_M` (15.7 GiB): unsloth's dynamic quants hold
quality better at the same rung, and the 0.7 GiB difference is affordable — the
projected total at 32K context is ~19.7 GiB against 24.0 GiB available. The README
carries the full ladder so dropping a rung is a one-line change.

## The backends

**llama-server, not Ollama or vLLM.** forge's own eval suite reports its top-10
configurations all running on llama-server, and `--jinja` gives real native function
calling. vLLM wants AWQ/GPTQ weights and is built for concurrent serving that a
single-user 4090 will not exercise.

**`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp`, pinned to an immutable per-build tag.** The floating
`server-cuda` tag pointed at build `b10200` (built 2026-07-31T08:46Z) at the time of
writing, and moves without warning. `.env` pins `server-cuda-b10200`; `update.sh`
reads the floating tag's `org.opencontainers.image.version` annotation to discover
the newest build and then pins *that* immutable tag. Reading the annotation beats
paging the tag list — the tags endpoint returns an unordered 100-tag page whose
newest entries were years stale.

**forge from PyPI, not from a git checkout.** `forge-guardrails==0.8.2` in a
`pip install` means updating is a version bump in `.env` and a rebuild, with no
submodule to keep in sync.

## Flags that are not obvious

Checked against `common/arg.cpp` at tag `b10200`:

- **`--jinja` is mandatory.** Without it llama.cpp ignores the `tools` parameter
  entirely. It does not error — it returns a perfectly normal text response, which
  reads as "this model is bad at tool calling" and sends you debugging the wrong
  thing. The smoke test asserts on `tool_calls` for exactly this reason.
- **`-fa` now takes a value** (`on`/`off`/`auto`). The bare `-fa` that older guides
  show is a parse error on current builds.
- **`--reasoning-budget` defaults to `-1` (unrestricted).** On reasoning-tagged
  models that is what lets a run fill the KV cache or hang. Capped at 4096 here;
  `0` disables thinking entirely.
- **`--reasoning-format deepseek`** is set explicitly so thoughts always land in
  `reasoning_content` instead of depending on template auto-detection.
- **`--no-context-shift`** makes an over-long conversation fail loudly instead of
  silently dropping the oldest tokens mid-session.
- Sampling defaults follow Qwen's thinking-mode recommendation (`temp 1.0`,
  `top_p 0.95`, `top_k 20`, `min_p 0.0`). Client requests still override them.

### forge flags

`--budget-mode manual --budget-tokens ${CTX_SIZE}` pins forge's budget to the same
number llama-server booted with, so forge never probes for it and the two can never
disagree.

`--inject-respond-tool` is **off** (it is opt-in as of forge 0.8.x). It exists to
keep ~8B models from wandering out of tool-calling mode; a 27B does not need the
crutch. `FORGE_EXTRA_FLAGS` is there if that turns out to be wrong in practice.

## Environment traps that cost real time

**Docker Desktop bind mounts resolve on the Windows side.** A WSL-style source path
mounts an **empty directory** — it does not fail. Verified directly:

```
$ docker run --rm -v /home/you/proj/scripts:/x:ro alpine ls /x
                                        # ← empty, no error
$ docker run --rm -v //c/users/you/proj/scripts:/x:ro alpine ls /x
setup.sh  up.sh  smoke-test.sh  ...
```

Consequences baked into this repo:

- `MODELS_DIR` must be a `//d/...` path, and is documented as such.
- The helper scripts are **COPY'd into the forge image** rather than bind-mounted.
  A `./scripts` mount would have silently mounted nothing and surfaced as
  "python: can't open file '/work/scripts/smoke_test.py'".
- Build contexts are unaffected — those are read by the Docker CLI, not the daemon.

**Model storage goes on D:.** C: had 44.1 GiB free against D:'s 7.6 TiB, and Docker's
own named volumes live on C: inside the VM's virtual disk.

**A stale ghcr credential breaks *anonymous* pulls.** `~/.docker/config.json` held an
expired PAT for `ghcr.io`; Docker sent it and the registry answered `denied` on a
public image. It presents as an access problem with the image, not with the local
credential. Fixed by re-issuing from `gh auth token`.

**`HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` is deprecated** — the first download run emitted a
`FutureWarning` pointing at `HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE`. The compose file and image
were switched to the Xet variant.

## Verification

`scripts/smoke_test.py` runs inside the compose network so it exercises the same
service names forge uses, rather than the host port mapping. It checks reachability,
`/props` (context size and that a tool-aware chat template actually loaded), a plain
completion, an **OpenAI-format tool call**, and an **Anthropic-format tool call** —
the last being the path Claude Code takes. `update.sh` runs it after every update and
rolls back the pins if it fails.

## Deliberately not done

- **MTP speculative decoding.** llama.cpp has `--spec-type draft_mtp` and unsloth
  publishes `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF` (the same quants, ~0.3 GB larger, MTP head
  embedded). It is a plausible throughput win but was not measured here, so it is not
  in the default path. To try it: point `MODEL_REPO` at the MTP repo, re-download, and
  set `LLAMA_EXTRA_FLAGS=--spec-type draft_mtp`.
- **Streaming through the proxy.** forge buffers responses rather than streaming
  incrementally, so a backend-side error arrives as an event inside an already-open
  200 stream. This is a documented forge limitation, not something this repo can fix.
- **Multi-model routing.** One model, one GPU, one slot (`-np 1`) so the single user
  gets the whole context window.
